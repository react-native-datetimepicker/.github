# Bug report

<!--
👋 Hi!

🚨 Please read the following carefully before opening a new issue. Your issue probably will
be closed if it doesn't follow the template. 🚨

Before submitting a new issue, please:

- Test using the latest release of the library in a React Native project, as maybe your bug has been already fixed. Please do not use Expo to reproduce bugs, because there might be a bug in Expo, not this library.
- Check for possible duplicate issues, with possible answers.

Still ready? Fill the template. 👇
